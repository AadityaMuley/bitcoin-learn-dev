To run the collection of JS files (assuming you have nodejs and npm pre-installed):

1. create a folder with a name of your choice:
    mkdir bchain-learn

2. navigate to that folder:
    cd bchain-learn

    npm init -y

4. install development dependancy - nodemon. nodemon along with npm capabilities has inbuilt live server capabilities which completely
   reloads and restarts our project when we make any changes:
    npm i nodemon --save-dev

5. add this line to package.json script after putting a comma (since name of file is dev-test.js):
    "dev-test": "nodemon dev-test"

    npm run dev-test
